# Privacy Policy for Steam Rep Counter

**Last Updated:** August 01, 2025

Look, this is a simple, open-source tool made by a gamer, for gamers. It's not some corporate spyware. But since the bigwigs in their glass towers require these fancy documents, here's the deal, written in plain English.

### **Article 1: We Collect Absolutely Nothing.**

Seriously. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

*   **Your personal data?** Don't want it. Don't need it. Don't care.
*   **Your browsing history?** As if we have time for that.
*   **Your deepest, darkest secrets?** We're a browser extension, not your therapist.

All the magic happens **locally, in your browser.** The extension reads public comments on Steam profiles, does some quick math, and shows you the result. It's that simple. We don't send your data to our secret underground lair, because we don't have one.

### **Article 2: Why We Need Permissions**

The extension asks for a couple of things to work. Here's why:

*   **`storage`:** This is to save **your** settings. You know, the theme you picked, the custom keywords you wrote. It's your stuff, saved on your computer. We can't see it.
*   **Access to `steamcommunity.com`:** Shocker, right? To count reputation on Steam, the extension kind of needs to *see* Steam. It only reads public information that's already visible to everyone.

### **Article 3: The "No Bullshit" Clause**

*   We **do not** sell your data. We wouldn't even know how.
*   We **do not** track you.
*   We **do not** have any third-party analytics that spy on you.

This extension was created to fight scammers and spammers, not to become one.

### **Article 4: The Bottom Line**

This is a free tool. Use it, enjoy it, check the source code on GitHub if you don't believe us. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got games to play.

If you have questions, open an issue on GitHub. Don't call a lawyer.
